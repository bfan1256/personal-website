            <Book title="Competition Demystified by Bruce Greenwald and Judd Kahn">
              Amazing read so far on how competition is broken down into various factors and how those play out in multiple case studies. 
              Critical for how to build out defensibility within modern products and where you can build sustainable competitive advantages.

            <Book title="Loonshots by Safi Bahcall">
              How do we cultivate incredibly ambitious ideas? What does that look like at scale or when you&apos;re just starting? When is it worth quitting and when is it worth not.
              Super awesome book so far.
