# Reflection October 25th 

It's the start of a new week. Just last week, we went to UGR. A time where I truly felt like God spoke to me. God, in his graciousness, showed me what his love truly means. To know that love that someone loves you is so different from truly knowing the love itself. For most of my life, and arguably my daily life, it's just so incredibly easy to get into a state where I remember the "fact" or truth that God loves me, but I never internalize it. It's as if I go around living life knowing that the Sun exists but never feel its rays.

As Rick Warren once said, the biggest distance is from the mind to the heart. Fortunately, the Lord truly broke through. For me, to experience his love, was to really think about how he loves me as a Father. In the many ways that we describe God, perhaps the way that I appreciate the most is God the Father. It's one thing to know that your parents love you. It's a whole other dimension to recognize that their love transcends beyond not just what you feel, but what you also see, what you experience. If your life was a theater play, your parents are pulling the curtains and strings in the background. For me, this reality dawned on me when I was 16, having a serious conversation with my mother. Hearing about all the things that they had to go through, to decide, to say yes to, to say no to, all for the sake of "us", their children. Another time in 2019, when I met with my grandmother in China. 
I still remember the time where she told me how my dad had called her one night, saying that being a parent was too hard, that day was after he disciplined me. 

With the realization of sacrifice that my parents have gave to me. How much more does the perfect, loving father have for us? For me, this was a huge thought experiment. If a perfect loving God truly existed, what would that look like? 

For me, the reality that God, in my whole life, has been orchestrating everything for my good (Jeremiah 29:11, Romans 8:28, Psalm 33:11). And orchestrating "my good" means for me to also experience hardships, pain, suffering, discomfort, anger. Arguably, those experiences were more powerful than the experiences of praise, worship, and more. 

To know that my heavenly father loved me so much that he was willing to sacrifice his own begotten son (his own) for me to bring me back to him, to take away all the transgressions, to be redeemed by him, and to continue and say "I won't just stop there, I want all of you and your life". Or moreso the reality that he *wants* to be a part of every aspect of my life, was in some ways, freeing. 
For me this was cemented when I realized that God loves me so much, he shaped me from the very beginning. God knows me more than I know myself (Romans 8:27). And if that is truly the case, then he knows how to use my gifts far more than I could ever even begin to steward them.

In exchange, he asks us to seek him. 

## Running Back to the Love of Jesus 

So I'm running, not running away, but running back. Running back to this "first love" of Jesus, putting it as the firm foundation of my faith. Knowing that this is the most important commandment for a reason (Matthew 22:37). Namely the true realization that if we prioritize Gods, all other idols will naturally fade away: jealousness, envy, covetousness, deceit, etc. 
To truly experience God's love, we must first let God love us, and live in light of his approval, and not our own condemnation. To restore our relationship with him we must first accept his love. 

How great is this reality. How countercultural, unfathomable, incomprehensible is this true reality that we are innocent until proven guilty. No, truly and completely innocent because someone else paid the debts of sin. 

It's less that we should simply run back to Jesus as a "right" response to what he did for us, but that it truly is what will satisfy our souls (Matthew 11:28, John 14:6, John 7:37). 
To recognize and internalize that there is nothing far more greater than the love of Jesus, 
than to experience his love in eternal communion with him, and cherish his love through prayer (Deuteronomy 30:6), 
thanksgiving and supplication, and to walk with him through the holy spirit on a day to day basis, 
I mean there truly is just nothing like it. 

His love encompasses our entire lives. It's not just church, it's not just our sin, but it's everything.

## Is My Soul Truly Resting

I think for our souls to rest, we have to remember that there is nothing else far better in life than to sit at the Lord's feet and just talk to him. For me, there are often times where I feel like prayer is pointless. Where I feel like God can't help me. Or oppositely, that I have everything in control. Yet how much more do we realize that even in these situations, God's view is so much wider and so much better. And truly how much rest does that give us. 
Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything in prayer and supplication (Philippians 4:6,7). That the peace of God guards our hearts. God wants us to be restful, indeed more importantly, to live a life in glory to him, we must enjoy him and his creation. That's what he wants! Not for us to labor and toil all day. 

Again, so counterintuitive to a society where everything is geared around climbing a corporate ladder. Oh how I fail here. Where I think that becoming successful out of my own ambition will suffice for my soul's rest.

I pray that the holy spirit may show me the parts in my life that I deserve to have more slack. That the holy spirit will highlight the areas in my life where I need to give it up to God so God can do things far more abundantly than I could according to his riches and wisdom. 

I pray that the words of Ecclesisates sit strong on my heart. Recognizing that every other path BUT God leads to true folly. 

Help me God to find rest by truly loving you. 



## A Final Prayer

God I haven’t been as faithful to you as I have wanted to be. I’ve been quick to run away. And yet I long to go back to you. To be embraced by you, loved by you, redeemed by you. There’s a space in my heart that is empty, waiting to be filled with your joy. 

God I want to come back to the heart of worship: you. God I want to be in your presence not because I must be, but because I want to be. God I want to desire you. To be called your child, reconciled by Jesus, saved by him, cherished by you. God I want my inner being to want you more than anything else; my soul at peace; my feet at rest. Lord satisfy me with the things above and not the things of this earth. Lord, be my shepherd, my provider, my friend. 

Lord to this end, my worship won’t ever stop, my song will know no end, my mouth shall never cease to speak of who you are. My days will be filled with your goodness, my heart forever rejoicing in your blessing. Lord build my life on your heart. Save my soul, empower me, embrace me, enable me. Bring me back to you. Again and again. Forever and ever. 


God you’re here with me now, in this moment, your truths hover over me, your arm extended towards me. My God may I draw near to you. Lord may my legs run like the wind back to you. God all the fears and doubts that I have about my startup, my work, my future, the way I live, the way I love, all of it God I now give to you. For Lord I count all of these things as loss, and in Christ I gain.

God I yearn to be in the presence of Christ, to be found in him, sanctified and adored by him, by you. For God I have this courage to know that you want me too. I have this truth that you are simply waiting. My God, oh my God, how majestic you are. How grateful I am to have you, to be close to you. 

God I give up my future to you. I give to you my dreams of my startup, I give to you my dreams of changing the world, I give to you my relationships, my family, Susie, all of things oh Lord I put at your feet. Trusting and knowing that God, I have no control but you do.

Lord inspire me to be more and more like you. Change my thoughts my attitude, my mind towards you my God, oh my God.


God I give up all these things, all my work, all my relationships, all my life. Because I know you love me. Because I know you love so so so much. You love me so much that you know what’s best for you, and all you ask in return is that I seek you. God it is only through this live can I truly be satisfied. All other things, Lord, will come. 

So God, break these chains of control, break these chains of unfaithfulness and fear. I give all of this to you because you love me 

Amen
