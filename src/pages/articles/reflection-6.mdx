     `It's the start of a new week. Just last week, we went to UGR. A time where I truly felt like God spoke to me. God, in his graciousness, showed me what his love truly means. To know that love that someone loves you is so different from truly knowing the love itself. For most of my life, and arguably my daily life, it's just so incredibly easy to get into a state where I remember the "fact" or truth that God loves me, but I never internalize it. It's as if I go around living life knowing that the Sun exists but never feel its rays.`,

# Reflection December 6th

Wow, what a grueling few months this has been. The last two months have been some of the most challenging, exhausting, time-testing, and truly desperate few months. I have never realized that customer calls could be so exhausting, meetings could be so draining, and burn out so real. 
Perhaps there are times where I just recognize that I am just running. Perpetually running - pushing forward towards some direction that frankly at times I'm not really sure where I'm going. 

Hmm, well let's start with some of the basics - have I been physically healthy? Yes absolutely! I've been playing basketball almost every day, getting daily exercise and time for myself. Emotionally? I think I'm okay, not like super highs and lows, definitely anxious. 
Work has definitely been growing stress and unknowns. I've realized more and more that I have no idea what I'm doing. Spiritually, it's been as good as it was for a while, though lately, I have definitely been struggling. 

## Oh My Heart, Why Are You So Fickle?

I've realized more and more that my heart is more fickle than I realized. It's so easily twisted, so easily moved in one direction compared to the other. So easily lost and misguided in all kinds of directions. Why? Perhaps it's a natural response to more stress than I can handle, or perhaps it's a lack of sleep. 
Or it's a desire for something more? A desire to want out. Moral of the story is, I find that my heart continues to change it's mind constantly. Where one day it might feel elated and stirred for a certain cause, the next it might be completely dead for it. 
Where once I saw a stir for God, now I sense a feeling of emptiness, some times maybe even dread? There is an element where I continue to wonder this simple question: "How could God truly love me?" "How could there be such a good God that loves me for who I am?" 
Out of my sin, out of my anger, out of all the struggle that I go through. God still loves me. And yet my response is to run in fear? My response to run is spiritual neglect. Maybe that's the issue that I've been faacing recently. 

## Roadblocks, Roadblocks

The hardest part about being a leader is that you have ot set deadlines. You can't just "lead" without imposing some constraints or restrictions. And yet it's those deadlines that make it so difficult to lead. For starters, you have to understand and scope things out.
You have to bygone know for sure how each one of your team members work. Who works fast but runs into a lot of errors? Who works slow? Who is gifted at A, who sucks at B? All of these have to be taken into consideration. Worse, you're constantly thinking whether or not the deadlines that you set are even good or legitimate.

Well good for me, I fall into the second half. I feel like I've gotten really bad at setting deadlines. Or maybe I've overestimated what our team at work can do. we constantly just continue to push back deadlines, what was supposed to take us a month, now has streteched to three. 
Frankly, the longer we stretch, the more scared and stressed I get. I have talked to 30-40 people now at this point for my work, and I'm so nervous to face any of them because I have no idea if we can do anything with it.

Not knowing what we're doing? - Roadblock. Not getting a response from a previous lead - Roadblock. Not having the tech working - Roadblock? HR Issues and people not working - Roadblock. It's like I've been perpetually thrown roadblock after roadblock, and I just continue to bear more and more burdens in order to continue to move forward. 

And I hate roadblocks, I hate them, it's not how I work. I'm a Type A - I know exactly when things should get done, I know when things should be finished, I know what is expected of me, and when I see other things falling through. I get pissed, and worse, I look down on myself. 
Perhaps there's an element of insecurity recognizing that I might not be that strong boy that I once thoguht I was. Or maybe I'm not that leader that I was expected to be, maybe I'm just "faking" it completely and am not even closing to "making it". 

## And Yet We Continue on

Yet despite these roadblocks, may I remember that even in the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. That God prepares a table in the presence of my enemies. That God is so so good. That despite my shortcomings and despite the failures that I'm going through now, God has such great plans in front of me.
That God hasn't forgotten about me, nor will he ever. God is continuously pursuing and working in his own way. That the present suffering that I endure or consisder, is nothing compared to the future that Christ has for me. I look forward to the conversations that I have in the future, because I know that God is with me. That God is for me. Now, of course, that doesn't detract away form the fact that life is stressful. 
That the work that I do is stressful, but it sure does provide comfort knowing that the God that can move mountains is, well moving.

Perhaps that's what I'm really fighting for this as I close out this year of 2022. May my faith not be a "seasonal" - may it be something endures the good and bad. May I remember that surely goodness and mercy will follow, and that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
That I may rememeber that God is working all things for my good. That God, which has called me into suffering, wants me to entrust myself to him - a faithful creator. 

Frankly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm constantly tired every day, work is taking it's toll on me. But I know this is for sure. That God is for me, and that he will continue to work for me. This I know, but do I believe, well that will take more time. But I know that God has continued to be faithful over and over again. 

## So what's next? 

Well we still have to build a product that people want. I still have to succeed before I have to come back to school, if I come back to school. And that's daunting and scary. Like holy sh*t bro. I need to get on it. I need to figure out and finalize everything that we're doing by the end of this semester and start trying to get this in front of people really quickly. 
As much as I would like to say that I have peace in my heart for it. I really don't. I'm just really worried, really really anxious. Lord please fix my heart. I think the next few months will really test my endurance and my faithfulness. Will I trust that God is sovereign over everything? Will I trust that the God that I know is moving for me and in me? 
Can I truly let go of my insecurities about leadership, about building a startup? Can I truly trust that God is good? I sure hope so. May I remember that God never promised life to be easy, but he did promise that life will be fulfilling to him. 

So I move forward. Every step and every circumstance. It's gonna be hard, and I hope things become easier. But we shall see. Until next time.
